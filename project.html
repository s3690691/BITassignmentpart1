      <p><h6>Project Description:</h6></p>
        <p>We are thinking about building a website for a game store. Our website will use html,css,javascript,php as the basis. There will be databases to store user information and product information. There will also be a game page to use in java.
<br>Our website will have five pages. (home page, about us page, store page, play with us page, contact us page) The main page will have some game information, such as new games or upcoming games. In the about us page, there will be information about our company, our team members, etc. In the store page, users can login and purchase products. These include games, game related or online exchange codes. We also created a special web page called “play with us”. In this page, we provide a small game and we will make a ranking list. All login users can challenge high scores. Finally is the contact us page, there will be a form through which users can submit any questions they have.

  <p> <b> 1. Workload </b> </p>
  <p>
    We are expecting at least forming up one group meeting per week,
    and the duration of each meeting should be at least one hour to share what we have done for the project individually.
  </p>

  <p> <b> 2. Beyong Current Capabilities </b> </p>
  <p>
    Most of our team members are good at html development,
    java programming and database skills are the areas that the majority of us are looking forward to improving.
  </p>

  <p> <b> 3. Project Risks and Challenges</b> </p>
  <p>
    Risks are the facts that discourages a project where the team members must face and overcome it.
    Decisions make risks more powerful and sometimes avoid them without any problem.
    Unfortunately, there are some risks and challenge that we will have to face while developing our project as team members.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b> Data Security: </b>
      <p>
        Data is the most significant aspect in the tech industry where the security of data breaches most of the time.
        Data of the project should not leak outside.
        Project data is sensitive, and all our team members should work to protect them with responsibility and care throughout the process.
        Also, data of the users must be protected and  implement a better security plan for the application.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> User Group: </b>
      <p>
        Developing an application for the wrong target users is a nightmare that can have as a project itself.
        If the chosen target user group refuses the app,
        it will be one of the biggest risks that can happen to a project after creating the application because it costs the money and hard work which the whole team spent through the process.
        Also, it will be the failure of the application in the first place.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Game Type: </b>
      <p>
        Games are now diverse and complicate. It is important to choose the type of games that we are supposed to develop.
        As our project is face to the whole society, this means our customers may be teenagers under 18 or adults.
        Therefore, games that we develop should consider the scale, which cannot be too violent and sexual related.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b> Team Dynamics related challenges: </b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b> Number of Group Meetings </b>
      <p>
        Since every team members are busy with different subjects and lots of assessments,
        it will be a challenge for us to gather together and have meetings.
        And also, in the situation like this, the only way to communicate is through online meeting.
        However, we will find out solutions for this after few weeks' collaboration, and hope we can overcome this challenge.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Wide Spectrum of Opinions </b>
      <p>
        As a group of six members, everyone has their own opinions and ideas.
        When it comes to draw a conclusion or make a decision, it will be difficult to finalize it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Jump out of "Comfort Zone' and Collaborate </b>
      <p>
        Six members may good at six different domains. It is challenge to acknowledge what we are good at and what we expect to improve.
        However, this does not mean members in the team should do all things that they not very good at.
        It is to collaborate and give full play to the best of the individual to help the team,
        in order to get high score.
      </p>
