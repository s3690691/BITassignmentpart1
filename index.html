  <p> 
    My Full Name is Baiwei Liu, my English name is “Bailey”, my student email address is s3778909@student.rmit.edu.au. 
    I have been studying in Australia for 5 years, I came to Australia in 2015 to attend a language school for half a year and then study in high school in 2016, so I'm good at writing analysis, my nationality is China.
    I’m very interested in Information technology and I love to explore the information about mobile phones. 
    My passion in IT is to learn new products, new ideas, new methods, I’m willing to learn and explore these new technologies.
    My strong point on IT is to use html/css to make a website, my weak point on IT is programming. 
    It's hard for me to make an application use Java, but I believe I can carry on and overcome these problems. 
    I can contribute to our team by writing analysis about the project and making a web page. 
    I can also challenge myself to use the Java programming language to contribute to our team, that can also help me learn more about Java.
  </p>

  <p> <b> Yitao Ma </b></p>
  <p>
    My RMIT Student Number is: s3843689
    My Personal Email address: Jerryma20010613@gmail.com
    My RMIT email address: s3843689@student.rmit.edu.au
    Hello, my name is Yi Tao Ma, 'Ethan' is my English name, I am from China and I immigrated to Australia in 2016 and have studied in Australia since ninth grade and finish my year 12 in 2019. 
    Chinese is my first language and unfortunately, I cannot celebrate most Chinese traditional festivals due to the long distance from Melbourne to China: 8463 km. 
    Which also makes me miss a lot of delicious Chinese food. Indeed, I missed my home country, but I also try to fit in Australia, learn Australian cultures and many others. 
    I believe I will be fine during the life of RMIT and Australia.
    I started to learn how to play the piano when I was 5 years old and I passed the piano level 10 examination. 
    Sometimes I still play the piano to make sure I do not forget the piano skills. I also love to cook some traditional Chinese food: Fried Noodles/Rice etc. 
    You know it is well to have some cooking skills to ensure you can keep yourself away from the starving.
    I often learn about the history of some computers and different kinds of programming. I think the code is very interesting because when I complete a complete program, I will experience an incomparable sense of accomplishment. 
    Today's world life is inseparable from it, it involves many fields, learning it can let me in the future in a better society. 
    Although the code and its knowledge are boring, it is the basis of the whole world, so I am still passionate about it.
    My weakness is java programming and databases, but it is not very weak. I can only say that I am not very skilled. I will work harder to master my weakness this semester, and I believe it will become better.
    I hope to play the role of web programming and Research (writing) in the project. Of course, it can also help to do some Java and database work.
  </p>

  <p> <b> Xin Lin </b></p>
  <p>
    Student Email: s3710267@student.rmit.edu.au<br>
    My name is Xin Lin, you can call me Lynn. I am from China, and I came to Australia to study in 2018. Before that, I finished my international business studies in China. 
    Then I worked for a year. I found that I was not interested in business, and then came to Australia to continue my study. 
    This is my second year of studying information technology. I just graduated from the Diploma of Information Technology last year. 
    In the process of learning IT, I think I am good at web programming, and I am very interested in it. In terms of database and Java, I think it needs to be improved. 
    I will do my best in this team project, work hard with the team members, and learn the aspects I am not good at.
  </p>

  <p> <b> Yuxiang Huang ( Project Leader )</b></p>
  <p>
    Student Number: s3751476
    Student Email: s3751476@student.rmit.edu.au
    My full name is Yuxiang Huang. I come from China. I came to Australia in 2019 and I finished diploma of IT last year in RMIT. 
    I think I have a basic understanding of information technology. Some computer games or mobile phone apps will make me interested in their development. As a result, I am passionate about design and development. 
    My strong point in terms of it is website design and weak points are Java code and database. 
    So I need to practise java code and database design more to improve myself through this course. 
    As for the contribution in this group, i hope i can do the website design part. As a team member, i will try my best to help my group complete this project and communicate with team members in time.
  </p>

  <p> <b> Wenlao Peng </b></p>
  <p>
    My full name is Wenlao Peng, my student email address is s3690691@student.rmit.edu.au. I have a big interest in studying IT, because I want to find out how the application works. 
    I finished my IT diploma last year. My specialty is making websites . I am used to asking team members to finish the work together. 
    I am better at doing HTML and database. What I'm not good at is making programs about Java. In the new semester, I want to challenge myself and improve my Java ability with the help of the team. 
    I will actively help the team to complete the task, which is my obligation. 
    What I hope most is to get high marks in this semester.   
  </p>

  <p> <b> Hang Yang </b> </p>
  <p>
    My full name is Hang Yang, and the preferred name is Bank. 
    My student email address is s3799719@student.rmit.edu.au. 
    I come to Australia to study for another 2 years as part of a requirement on my study program in China. 
    I was inspired by Steve Jobs who gave me the passion for mobile phone and mobile application. 
    My strong points are coding, editing videos and some html designing. My weak points are database and algorithm implementation. 
    I would like to develop my database skills through this course. Like all of the members in our group, the challenge is to cooperate with teammates and present a good project. 
    To contribute in this team, I can do the coding stuff and probably give some advice on how we can improve our project.

    <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Github:</b>
          <p>
          Github has been a helpful instrument in completing this project.
          Through Git, we could identify who modified the codes, who added their work and which part they have changed.
          It was also easier to use as the platform is simple to understand, even for someone that does not really have deep knowledge in IT.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Eclipse:</b>
          <p>
          Eclipse is an open source, Java based, extensible development platform, and it is completely free of charge.
          It  makes it a development tool for C + +, python, PHP and other languages through plug-ins.
          We can write code in the eclipse to build our Java based project.
          We use this tool because it is simple and necessary for a Java based project.
          Alternatively we can use IntelliJ IDE or NetBeans as the programming tool, these are also free and helpful tools.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> Visual Studio Code </b>
          <p>
            Visual studio code (vs Code) is a free code editor developed by Microsoft and supports windows, Linux and MacOS operating systems.
            It is usually used for web development, it is a good tool as it contains several features such as code completion, code fragment and code refactoring.
            The editor supports user personalization, such as changing theme color, keyboard shortcut and other attributes and parameters.
